Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly important topic in the field of retail analytics. With the rise of big data and advanced analytics, AI tools have become essential for retailers to make better business decisions. In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the background and fundamentals of AI, including the types of AI.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
--------------------------------

Artificial Intelligence refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation. The key objective of AI is to create intelligent machines that can work and think like humans.

Types of Artificial Intelligence
--------------------------------

There are two main types of AI:

### 1. Narrow or Weak AI

Narrow or Weak AI, also known as Applied AI, is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited range of capabilities. These AI systems are focused on solving narrow problems and do not possess the general intelligence associated with human beings. Examples of narrow AI include image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

### 2. General or Strong AI

General or Strong AI, also known as AGI, refers to machines that possess human-like intelligence and are capable of performing any intellectual task that a human being can do. This type of AI does not yet exist, but it is the ultimate goal of AI research.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, AI is a rapidly developing technology that has enormous potential to transform the retail industry. Retailers can leverage AI tools to gain insights from large amounts of data, automate routine tasks, and improve the overall customer experience. Understanding the different types of AI is essential for retailers to choose the right tools for their needs and to develop effective AI strategies.
